The Cameras package is a package that is responsible for communicating video
feed across ROS nodes.

- Local setup

    Initiate ROS Core:

        $ roscore
    
    Run camera.py and receiver.py:

        $ rosrun cameras camera.py
        $ rosrun cameras receiver.py

    If everything is set up properly, you should see the video feed show up.

- Network setup

    ** Make sure you are using the VIP2400 routers.
    
    After connecting the routers make sure that each machine's hostname is 
    registered in the other's /etc/hosts file. To do this, find the IP and 
    hostname of each machine:

    <USER>@<HOSTNAME>$ ifconfig

    Then open /etc/hosts in both machines and add the other's IP hostname 
    combination in the file. It should look like the following:

        /etc/hosts

        127.0.0.1 localhost
        ...
        <IP> <HOSTNAME>
        ...

    When you have made changes to the /etc/hosts file, run the following
    on both machines. The "MASTER" or "REMOTE" inside the arrows brackets
    denotes the machine to run the command on. This notation will be used for 
    the remainder of the README:

        <MASTER>$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
        <REMOTE>$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

    Next, choose one of your machines to be the master, and run the 
    following on both machines:

       <MASTER>$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<MASTERHOSTNAME>:11311
       <REMOTE>$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<MASTERHOSTNAME>:11311
 
    Next, initiate ROS Core on the master machine:

        <MASTER>$ roscore
    
    Run camera.py on the master machine:

        <MASTER>$ rosrun cameras camera.py

    Run receiver.py on the remote machine:

        <REMOTE>$ rosrun cameras receiver.py

    If everything is set up properly, you should see the video feed show up on
    the remote machine.
