The Software directory will consist of two different directories:
    - Incubation
    - Workspace

The idea is that all code that we write will eventually be wrapped as a ROS 
package/node. Therefore, all the code will eventually belong under 'Workspace' 
which is our ROS workspace.

However, it is understandable to separate code from ROS for testing purposes. 
Such code will temporarily live in 'Incubation' where it will need to be worked 
on and verified before it is moved to 'Workspace'.
