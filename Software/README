The Software directory will consist of two different directories:
    - Incubation
    - Workspace

All code that we write will eventually be wrapped as a ROS package/node. 
Therefore, all the code will eventually belong under 'Workspace' which is our 
ROS workspace.

However, it is understandable to separate code from ROS for testing purposes. 
Such code will temporarily live in 'Incubation' where it will need to be worked 
on and verified before it is moved to 'Workspace'.

To find out more about specific custom ROS packages, go to the package directory 
underneath Workspace/src. If you cd into the package directory, there will be 
a README that contains the author's email as well as instructions. Email only
if you are having trouble after reading the instructions.

** Make sure that you run the following:

    $ source Workspace/devel/setup.bash
    $ catkin_make
